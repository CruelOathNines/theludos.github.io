        <p>Game Development is a necessary step in any kind of game to make sure that nothing that could hinder the player's experience, makes it to the final product. What exactly happens if something goes wrong during the development stage or if it's been caught on in the final publish of the game?</p>

                    <img src="https://wi-images.condecdn.net/image/Nrk9WEmqZVV/crop/810/landscape/f/Missingno.jpg" width="450px">
                    <p>The process of creating a video game from the outside may look simple, but the intricate building blocks, components and foundations that fit together to form what players can now interact with is not an easy job. At the same time, that difficult task can prove to be a lot more of a challenge when the game faces one of the most common forms of struggle in video game commands: Bugs and Glitches.</p>
                     
                    <p>Game developers use game engines as of modern-day video game development to create the levels, the aesthetic, and the general space that will be the 'playground' for the players to play around in upon the game's release. However, in the case that bugs and glitches are of an issue, may it be not so common problems or frequently occurring bugs and glitches, the players' experience of coming across an issue in the game's programming can put the player off from having an enjoyable experience with the game. Bugs and glitches come in many different forms albeit some more common than others, but the simple presence of a coding issue even with the appearance of only one, can deteriorate the rating and expected approach players take towards the game if it means there is a chance they will come across a problem again.</p>
                     
                    <p>Bugs and glitches are software errors that are a result of game programming and game coding, often from faulty or completely missed errors in the line of code that can end up in the game, causing drastic and sometimes catastrophic problems. Not all major and popular games released today has near-perfect coding in the program, and Triple-A games out on the market face their share of bugs and glitches that can potentially ruin a player's experience if they ever come across it.</p>
                     
                    <p>While some bugs can hinder a player's experience, some players can potentially exploit the presence of a glitch and use it for their benefit to stride through a video game with considerable ease, although it may not be what the game developers intended the players to experience the game through.</p>
                     
                    <p>Looking in-depth at how bugs and glitches occur and what types are most common, here is a list of the most re-occurring and most frequent forms of faults in a program that can sometimes make it to the final product.</p>
                     
                    <h3 class="titleh3">Crashes and Freezes</h3>
                     
                    <p>Crashes, also sometimes referred to as Crash to Desktop (CTD) is when a game stops processing, blocks or completely exits the game entirely during the start-up or current playthrough of a game. Crashes or 'freezes' are often the results of accidental coding or mistakes in the program that can lead to games cutting midway or during the start-up of a game when the console or computer reads through the program.</p>
                     
                    <p>In most common circumstances, when a game freezes and stops at a certain point or level, players are forced to either restart their game from scratch or have to retry a particular level repeatedly to bypass or successfully run pass the bug in the game's coding. Game developers are highly cautious about issues that involve crashing and freezing, as even one crash in the program can mean a terrible journey for the player to return to a particular point, or annoyance over the inability to experience the game.</p>
                     
                    <p>In some places, the cause of game crashes may not always be from the game's coding. Crashes and freezes occur from the system reading through the program and running the results, so often at times, if a console or a computer is not at the most recommended or most suitable quality to run through the program without issues, problems such as crashes and freezes can occur.</p>
                     
                    <h3 class="titleh3">Graphical Errors</h3>
                     
                    <p>Components and items in the game that are used for visual or interactable purposes are visually identified through visual aesthetic and textures. The graphical texture of an item to distinguish it from other items in the game gives players the ability to identify boundaries, limited space, interactable objects and playable areas. In some cases, if a game faces a bug or glitch in the textural field of the program, the visual identity of the terrain or the item can be misinterpreted or lost by players who potentially face a completely invisible object or a vast unappealing textured land.</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/assassins-creed-unity-glitch.jpg" width="420px">
                    
                    <p>When graphical errors occur in games, it can cause challenges for the player in their experience when certain displays of textures are not properly run or read in the game's program. For example, games can include out-of-bounds objects to separate players from areas that should not be discovered or played within, but if a graphical error occurs, sometimes out-of-bound objects and their textures can be missed entirely resulting in what is known as an 'invisible wall'. This can prevent players from being able to read or comprehend aspects of the game that require clear indications of directions, to ensure that players do not run off in the wrong direction or head towards the wrong track in their games.</p>
                     
                    <p>Graphical errors are not of a major issue, but they can prove to be annoying for some players when experiencing textural issues that can prevent them from interpreting the game's visuals into identifiable components.</p>
                     
                    <p>There are different kinds of textural and graphical bugs and glitches. An infamous example of such is the texture labelled "MissingNo.", a sprite found in the video game released on the GameBoy, <em>Pokemon Red and Blue</em>. 'MissingNo.' is the graphical texture error of a pokemon, creatures found in the fictional world of the Pokemon games that were read mistakenly and displayed as a glitched texture in the shape of a backwards 'L'. The sounds and texture of the pokemon have found its way into players games which made its appearance in iconic and infamous discoveries in video game history. Though while the MissingNo texture remained throughout the RPG-like battle system of the Pokemon franchise, players were still able to continue playing through their game once they had defeated the Pokemon.</p>
                     
                    <h3 class="titleh3">Physics Glitches</h3>
                     
                    <p>As of modern-day game development, a lot more games found in the Triple-A (distributed and published by major developers who produce games on a higher budget and higher development) category render their games in 3D environments. 3D environments allow for the sense of realism and pragmatism in their video games, but they can come with responsive issues that can potentially fail and ruin the experience of players who encounter not-so-realistic issues.</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://infosnacks.com/img/2012/video-game-glitches.jpg" width="420px">

                    <p>Physics Glitches and bugs occur as a result of accidentally caused or entirely random faults in the game programming that can cause issues in the interaction of objects or the general concept of realism in games. Physics errors come in many forms, such as being flung into the air by the light touch of a moving obstacle or clipping through the ground in uneven terrain. When certain objects placed in particular areas are interacted with, some players can even enter areas that are not to be explored until they complete an objective.</p>
                     
                    <p>These glitches are not often intended and can be caused by the mistake of the program once it's run to bypass through other aspects of the games programming and cause unintended and unexplained events. In 3-dimensional environments, it can create unrealistic and potentially game-breaking events, so depending on the player and the game, physics in a faulty video game can either be amusing or annoying and unfortunate for game developers.</p>
                     
                    <h3 class="titleh3">Gameplay and Command Defects</h3>
                     
                    <p>Many video games are interactable through the commands input into their program that is eventually run through and read to allow the ability for players to initiate an action. As games nowadays have almost perfect input to output time reaction, some video games can come across problems involving the commands directed towards objects and input settings that can cause problems in the interaction of the environment.</p>
                     
                    <p>Gameplay and command defects are often problems associated with interactable objects and the coded programming written for a command. Commands such as pressing the 'W' button on a keyboard to move forward, or pressing 'A' on a controller to attack, may not often be read properly, or a problem regarding what is read can result in problems that players may potentially exploit or encounter annoying problems with.</p>
                     
                    <p>On many occasions, gameplay and command defects that can involve exploitation from the players are deemed as forms of 'cheating' and seen as unfair examples of experiencing a game not intended for the exploited purpose. As a result, many game developers who come across exploitation from their bugs can often ban or permanently remove players from experiencing their games due to their actions.</p>
                     
                    <h2 class="problemh2">WHAT PLAYERS TAKE FROM BUGS AND GLITCHES</h2>
                     
                    <p>Bugs and Glitches are quite obviously not intended by game developers in the case issues end up in the final product of their video games, but when players encounter the issues and experience the problems that arise from these issues, players can take it one way or another.</p>
                     
                    <p>Many video games out on the market currently hold infamous or enjoyable moments for players who have stumbled upon the bugs and glitches. While many issues are not quite intended, some issues can, however, cause different emotions and experiences for certain players that can potentially stick with their memories of a game for a while.</p>
                     
                    <p><b>Amusing and harmless</b> bugs and glitches are of a common appearance in the gaming industry and many social media platforms that share the word of these issues are what brings the enjoyment and laughter of gaming bugs and glitches to light in video games. Take Bethesda's <em>The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</em>, a game infamous for their hilarious game textures on NPC (Non-Playable Characters) and their sound output due to the game's massively expansive world and rendering that can cause problems in the way a character looks.</p>
                     
                    <p>The game does not purposefully intend on the characters to look distorted, but as a result of the incredibly huge world that <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> games build upon, loading the game's textures and reading through the program can sometimes create not-so-appealing images of characters that have not been loaded in properly.</p>

                    <p>Some bugs and glitches may not always come out for the enjoyment of it, and there have been many examples in video games over the history of the gaming industry that showcase the <b>weirder and scarier</b> side of bugs and glitches that appear in the playable games. Misread coding or missing variables can sometimes cause problems in how an object or event can be heard/presented, and in very small cases, they can be almost hauntingly spooky or traumatic if it wasn't intended but gives off a sense of eeriness and unusual meaning of discovery.</p>
                     
                    <p>An infamous example of a spooky and scary bug and glitch in a video game is Bethesda's <em>Fallout: New Vegas game</em>. While the game is not completely perfect and having a rather good rating from player experience, some players can face rendered entities and NPC's that have missing components to their visuals that result in floating body parts and missing chunks of their bodies giving an eerie skeletal look to their appearance.</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Fallout-New-Vegas-Creepy-Glitch.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=416&dpr=1.5" width="450px">

                    <p>In some of the worst-case scenarios, however, video games can be the ultimate bomb that sets off a catastrophe of events that can be <b>annoying and even game-breaking</b> for some players. These bugs and glitches may not be intended, but they can prove to be tedious and often unenjoyable for players wishing to experience a good video game to play. When coming across game-breaking and annoying bugs and glitches, it can set expected negative ratings and feedback from the players who issue complaints regarding the process of game development and its completely missed reading of the issue.</p>
                     
                    <p>One game that has gained a negative reception for its development and final release to the public is the 2010 Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) released by Square Enix, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. From it's release to the wider audience in 2010, Square Enix has made many patches and updates, along with downloadable contents to its game that fixes the messy bugs and glitches and gave it a negative reception and response from the day it became public. Reviewers and critics rated the game poorly for its tedious and unenjoyable gameplay, poor command controls and terrible user interface.</p>
                     
                    <p>Over the years as the game developers at Square Enix for <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> worked on fixing the game, it has received much better views regarding its performance and delivery to the public in comparison to its dull and memorable moments throughout the game for being unenjoyable.</p>
                     
                    <p>While video games may not ever be completely perfect and free from the bugs and glitches that roam within the code of their program, video game developers, whether it be minor indie developers or major Triple-A distributors aim to find ways to prevent these issues from reaching the public through a method many know as,</p>
