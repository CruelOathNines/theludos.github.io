                        <p>Our Solution Designer, <em>Natarsha</em>, has been the person who has stuck with the team, showing them the ropes and making sure our layouts follow similar structures. She's the individual in our group that has structured our design and made tweaks to it's look that brings you here to the final product of our effort. While she isn't the writer for the solution, she's the writer for the foundation of our entire work.</p>

                <p>We are a group of four senior students who are investigating the depths of information about game development, its problems and ways to solve them.</p>

                <p>Our group consists of our names which go by Alicia (Project Manager), Ash (Lead Programmer), Emily (Co-Programmer) and Natarsha (Solution Designer).</p>
                    
                <p>We will be diving into the coding errors that occur within the construction of games in this topic, and discover ways to solve the problems to prevent the errors from in-game performance.</p>
                    
                <p>We are going to discuss about this matter by introducing the concept of game development, along with further analysis of the topic, the problems game development faces and how the issues are dealt with for a smooth continuation of development towards producing a final product for public release.</p>
