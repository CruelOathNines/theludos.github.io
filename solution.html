        <p>Bugs and Glitches are almost everyday conflicts that game developers face throughout their testing for their games. For this to be avoided and prevent it from reaching the final release of the video game, a few members within the team (and even the public) join in to aid in spotting the hidden among the curtains.</p>

                <p>Play testing is a process that is intended to find in video games so that they can be rectified by the game developers.</p>
            
                <p> Play testing involves people playing the game, and checking certain features or sections of the games for anything that would be either unintended or a ‘bug’/defect with the programming. The tester will need to describe the bug in detail along with how it occurs, preferably with a video or picture of the bug occurring so that the developers can recreate it and debug it on their end.</p>

				<p> It allows the developers to find the bugs before the release of the game or update to the public which allows them more time knowing about the bug, 
				that means they have more time to solve the bug if it is game-breaking or breaks immersion.</p>
				
				<p> Playtesting is important as the bugs being found before the game is released means there is less chance for the bugs to slip past and cause players to experience game-breaking bugs, allowing them to have the intended experience with no major bugs interfering with their experience. </p>
                <p> Here is an example of a minor bug that likely could have been solved before the release if they had tested it beforehand and fixed it; </p>
