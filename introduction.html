                    <p>For our IT group, our main focus for our methodology has been based on the problems and issues that arise over the programming events in Game Development. The Video Game industry is one of the biggest rising industries as of the 21st Century, and the world has seen video games rise from the depths of various countries around the world producing enjoyable, fun and memorable interactable adventures that children as young as toddlers to the elderly can play on. </p>

                    <p>Video Games is defined as an interactable electronically manipulated set of images that create a controllable display of viewed pictures that move and allow players to command and 'take over' what occurs on the screen. Video games have been around since the 1950's, when the first ever video game released in 1958 called 'Pong' paved the way for the innovation of technology and the impact of individuals controlling what they see. </p>

                    <p>Since the introduction of 'Pong', involving two sliding rectangles from one side of the screen to the side of the axis bouncing a white ball to either rectangles, video games have drastically changed in many ways. To compare the difference between the video games of the 20th Century to the games featured in present day, the technology used to display what we can interact with has improved by milestones. Video Game companies' efforts to strive for the effect of realism, or the aim to bring immersion and 'hook' into their environment has now been a main focus in today's development of video games. </p>
                    
                    <p>The world has seen a change in graphics quality, program running machines, console machine size reduction and space size enlargement. The aim to make games as perfect, smooth, enjoyable, immersing and impactful has set a remarkably high standard over the years, with the bar rising up higher as the development of technology improves through time. This means, however, that as time follows through, what video games were considered to be the wave-makers of then, can be ignored and swept aside for the people today. Video Games that 90's kids found to be a cherishing memory that makes up their childhood can be seen as almost disappointingly low-level in today's generations' standards. </p>

                    <p>As a result, game developers in Video Game companies such as Nintendo, Bethesda, EA Games, Capcom, and many others, have improved their quality and level of improvement over the years through one of the most important stages in the making, </p>

                    <p>Game Development is defined as the stage in a video game's making and production that involves the programming, coding and creation of the game. When it comes to video games - console and PC distribution - the development and process that involves writing up the program and its system is one of the most important and most crucial stages that all members of the production will need to look over to make sure the final product is ready to be released to the public in hopes of a positive reception from the players.</p>
                    
                    <p>Video Games from different developers, whether a game is made entirely by one individual, a small group of individuals of no corporation (indie game developers), bigger game companies and the Triple A companies in the video game industry, the development of their games is what creates the foundation and basic blueprint of the final piece.</p>

                    <iframe width="720px" height="420px" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luIUJ5sgT1I"></iframe>
                    
                    <p>How a video game comes out upon its release can determine many factors for the individuals or companies who have developed the game. Smaller groups of individuals can face a spike in reputation and a collection of money received from a positively received game they have made, and on the other scale, even Triple A companies can face close to bankruptcy upon a miserably failed video game released to the public.</p>
                    
                    <p>The stage of game development is what shapes and reforms the sensation, perception and interpretation of the video game when it is released. The building blocks of fanbases, fandoms, small fan communities and modern day events such as eSports events have been created as a result of the impact of game development.</p>
                    
                    <p>For our group, we will be taking an in-depth look at how game development can have its fair share of troubles and problems, and how developers work around it to achieve the remarkable result players experience within their hands.</p>
